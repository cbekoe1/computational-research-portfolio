# Computational Research Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of **research‑grade computational modeling projects** across four major scientific domains:

- **Wind & Renewable Energy Modeling**
- **Infectious Disease Dynamics**
- **Climate & Energy Systems Analysis**
- **Numerical Optimization & Applied Mathematics**

Each project demonstrates a complete scientific workflow:  
**mathematical formulation → numerical implementation → analysis → visualization → research‑grade reporting.**

## Repository Structure

Every project follows a consistent, professional layout:

- **`src/`** — Modular, reproducible Python code  
- **`data/`** — Input datasets and generated synthetic data  
- **`results/`** — Figures, tables, and model outputs  
- **`report/`** — A polished PDF report written in RMarkdown  
- **`README.md`** — Project‑level documentation  

Core tools and libraries include:

- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)  
- Optimization libraries (PuLP, CVXOPT, SciPy Optimize)  
- Time‑series modeling (Statsmodels, Prophet where applicable)  
- ODE solvers and simulation frameworks  
- RMarkdown for scientific reporting

## Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates the ability to:

- Build mathematical and computational models of real systems  
- Implement robust numerical methods and simulations  
- Analyze and interpret complex datasets  
- Apply optimization techniques to engineering and economic problems  
- Communicate results through clear, research‑grade reports  

It reflects the skill set of a **computational researcher**, **modeling specialist**, and **applied mathematician**.
